### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I am a Full-Stack Web Developer. I attended Lambda School and have gained experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, styled-components, LESS, SASS, PostgreSQL, node, and Postman. I have gained many other skills from Lambda that go beyond coding, such as working in a team, working remotely, and handling multiple tasks at once. Im excited to keep building off of what I no and gaining new skills as I go to further my knowledge in the tech world!



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on new projects to showcase my skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ant-D and Ruby On the Rails
